# pandas-challenge

Attached please find the documents for the Module 4 Challenge within the PyCitySchools folder:
    - The PyCitySchools_SW.ipynb file that features all of the calculations and the final analyses.
    - A 'Resources' folder with two csv files ('schools_complete' and 'students_complete') that were read as part of the PyCitySchools .ipynb file
    
    Thank you!
